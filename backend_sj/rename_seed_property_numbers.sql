-- Renames the seeded assets' property numbers from the 'SEED-YEAR-####'
-- placeholder format to the app's real 'COA-YEAR-###' format, so they're
-- indistinguishable from assets created through the UI.
--
-- Run this ONCE, right after seed_2000_assets.sql, before any real
-- COA-numbered assets are created for the affected years (otherwise
-- their per-year sequence continues from whatever's already there —
-- which is safe, just first-run-only by design since a second run
-- would find no more 'SEED-%' rows left to rename).
--
-- Step 1 records which asset_ids belong to the seed batch into a
-- permanent marker table (`seed_batch_assets`) BEFORE renaming, since
-- the 'SEED-' prefix — the only other way to identify this batch — is
-- about to be overwritten. cleanup_seed_2000_assets.sql depends on
-- this table to know what to remove later.
--
-- Run against whichever database you loaded the seed into:
--   mysql -u root gso_inventory < rename_seed_property_numbers.sql
