# 019 — Replace the shared `motionCurve` builtin with a strong custom curve

- **Status**: TODO
- **Commit**: de894c7
- **Severity**: LOW (but wide blast radius — touches every animated surface in the app)
- **Category**: Easing & duration / Cohesion
- **Estimated scope**: 1 file changed (`mobile_sj/lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart`), but the effect is felt across every consumer of `AppTheme.motionCurve` — currently: `page_transitions.dart` (every screen transition), `staggered_entrance.dart` (every list/card cascade), the dashboard's count-up numbers and lifecycle ring, and every plan in this set that references `AppTheme.motionCurve` (006, 007, 009, 014, 015, 018).

## Problem

```dart
// mobile_sj/lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart:100-105 — current
// Motion tokens — restrained, functional timings (not playful/bouncy) so
// transitions read as "responsive UI", matching an enterprise system's tone.
static const Duration motionFast = Duration(milliseconds: 160);
static const Duration motionMedium = Duration(milliseconds: 260);
static const Duration motionSlow = Duration(milliseconds: 420);
static const Curve motionCurve = Curves.easeOutCubic;
```

`Curves.easeOutCubic` is Flutter's builtin cubic-out curve — serviceable, but exactly the kind of "built-in easing is too weak for deliberate motion" case AUDIT.md #2 calls out; it lacks the initial punch of a purpose-built strong ease-out. Since this one token is reused for literally every entrance/transition in the app (every page push, every staggered card, the dashboard's number count-ups and ring reveal), its relative softness is inherited everywhere.

## Target

```dart
// target
static const Curve motionCurve = Cubic(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1);
```

`Cubic(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)` is Flutter's `Curve` equivalent of the CSS `cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)` — the exact "strong ease-out for UI" curve from AUDIT.md #2. Flutter's `Cubic` class takes the same four control-point parameters as a CSS cubic-bezier, so this is a direct, faithful port of the same curve already used conceptually in this session's frontend work (and coincidentally close to the `EASE_ENTER`/`cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` used by the web app's own entrances, per plan 011 — the two clients won't share byte-identical curves, but both move toward the same "strong ease-out" character).

## Repo conventions to follow

- `Curve`/`Cubic` come from `package:flutter/animation.dart`, already transitively available via the existing `package:flutter/material.dart` import in `app_theme.dart` — no new import needed.
- This is a single-line, single-token change specifically BECAUSE the app already centralized its curve into one shared constant — this plan is only possible/safe because that consolidation already happened; do not scatter the new `Cubic(...)` literal anywhere else, keep it defined exactly once here.

## Steps

1. In `mobile_sj/lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart`, change line 105 from `static const Curve motionCurve = Curves.easeOutCubic;` to `static const Curve motionCurve = Cubic(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1);`.
2. Do not touch `motionFast`/`motionMedium`/`motionSlow` — only the curve.

## Boundaries

- Do NOT touch any consumer of `AppTheme.motionCurve` — this plan is a single-token change; every other file automatically picks up the new curve by referencing the same constant.
- Because this affects every animated surface in the app simultaneously, this plan should be executed and feel-checked in isolation from other plans in this set — do not batch it together with unrelated plans in the same review pass, so a feel regression (if any) is easy to attribute and revert.
- If the new curve feels noticeably "snappier to the point of harsh" on the dashboard's 1100ms ring-reveal specifically (a long-duration animation where a strong ease-out's early punch might read differently than on a short 160-260ms UI transition), note that as a specific observation in your final report — do not silently carve out an exception for it without flagging the tradeoff, since AUDIT.md's guidance is for this exact curve to be used broadly, but a long-duration outlier is worth calling out rather than burying.

## Verification

- **Mechanical**: `flutter analyze` (from `mobile_sj/`) — clean; confirm `Cubic` resolves without a new import needed (it should, via the existing `material.dart` import chain — if not, add `import 'package:flutter/animation.dart';` explicitly and note that you needed to).
- **Feel check** — this is the single highest-leverage feel-check in this entire plan set, since it touches everything:
  - Navigate between at least 3 different screens (e.g. Dashboard → Assets → an asset detail) and confirm the page transitions feel slightly snappier/more responsive at the start of the motion, without looking jerky or overshooting.
  - Open a list screen (Assets/Maintenance/Disposal) and watch the staggered card entrance — confirm the cascade still reads as smooth, not abrupt.
  - Open the Dashboard and watch the count-up numbers and the lifecycle ring reveal — specifically check whether the ring's 1100ms draw looks noticeably different in character (see the Boundaries note above); describe what you observe.
  - Do this comparison in slow motion if possible: temporarily multiply `motionFast`/`motionMedium`/`motionSlow` by 4x locally (do NOT commit this test change) to see the curve's shape more clearly, then revert before finishing.
- **Done when**: `AppTheme.motionCurve` is `Cubic(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)`, every consumer picks it up automatically with no other file changes, and you've explicitly recorded your feel-check observations (especially on the long-duration ring reveal) in your final report.
